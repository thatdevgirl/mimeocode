# Mimeocode

A Node module to copy boilerplate code for new projects, cloned from Github.

## Installation

Install dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

### Troubleshooting

If you run into any Node-related issues, you probably should make sure you are on a relatively recent version of Node. I would say at least v.10.

## Usage

In a terminal screen, use the following command to run this tool:

`node index.js [project] [destination]`

Available projects include:
* gutenberg-block
* gutenberg-plugin
* static-website
* wordpress-theme

## Original premise

### Pitch
/want to play with node/
/and create project bootstraps/
/letâ€™s marry the two/

### Things I learned during Serendipity Day
* Github organizations to separate out repos
* Tagging repos (also for organizational purposes)
* Github project boards
* Node and file manipulation is not as hard as I thought it would be.
* I really need to organize all my boilerplate templates. They are everywhere!
