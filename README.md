# Mimeocode

A Node module to copy boilerplate code for new projects, cloned from Github.

Install dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

If you run into any Node-related issues, you probably should make sure you are on a relatively recent version of Node. I would say at least v.10.

`node index.js [project] [destination]`
